> The ultimate tool for managing your Steam account licenses. This script transforms the default licenses page into a powerful management utility, allowing you to safely clean up unwanted items like demos, betas, and old trailers.

It provides a safe, interactive workflow: it scans your entire library, presents a list of matches to review, and **cannot remove paid games or DLC**. Your purchases are always safe.

## ‚ú® Key Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîí **Safe By Design**              | **Cannot remove paid games or DLC.** The script can only interact with Steam's function for removing *free* licenses, so your purchased library is always safe. |
| üîé **Comprehensive Scanning**      | Automatically scans **all pages** of your licenses, finding every match without manual effort.                                                         |
| ‚úÖ **Interactive Review**     | After scanning, you are presented with a detailed list of matches. **Nothing is removed without your final approval.**                      |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Exclusion Filtering**       | Protect specific licenses using an **exclusion list**. An item will be ignored even if it matches your main keywords (e.g., keep a specific "beta"). |
| üíæ **Persistent Settings**         | Configure your keywords once. The script saves your preferences locally in your browser so they are ready for your next session.                     |
| üìä **Progress and Control**      | A dynamic progress bar shows the status of removals, and a **Cancel** button lets you safely abort the process at any time.                            |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Rate-Limit Handling** | Automatically detects when Steam's API limit is hit, pauses the process, and resumes when it's safe to continue.                                          |
| üìÑ **Summary & Export**            | After cleaning, view a detailed summary of removed licenses. You can **export this list to a `.txt` file** for your personal records.                         |

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Can this script remove my paid games or DLC?</strong></summary>
<br>
No. Absolutely not. The script is specifically designed to only find and use Steam's function for removing <i>free</i> licenses (like demos, betas, and free weekends). It is fundamentally incapable of interacting with licenses that have a purchase record. Your paid library is completely safe.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the license removal permanent?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. This script uses Steam's own license removal function. Once a free license is removed, it is gone from your account permanently. The multi-step review and confirmation process is designed to prevent accidental removals.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the script identify licenses to remove?</strong></summary>
<br>
The script scans license names for your <strong>inclusion keywords</strong> (e.g., "demo", "beta"). However, if a name also contains one of your <strong>exclusion keywords</strong>, it will be ignored, giving you fine-grained control.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I encounter a rate limit?</strong></summary>
<br>
If you are removing a large number of licenses, Steam's server may temporarily block further requests. The script will detect this, display a "Rate limited" status, wait for 30 seconds, and then automatically continue where it left off.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I trust this script with my account?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. The script is open-source and runs entirely within your browser. It does not send your data anywhere except to Steam's own servers, exactly as if you were clicking the remove button yourself. It cannot see your password or perform any other actions.
</details>
